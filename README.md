My ISP service provider is a close big brother to me. So one day, he was saying he needs a panel to manage his clients, cable tv users, internet users, there payments, employees etc.
I had no job at that time, so because I had free time, I created this one. This is also when I was beginner level in laravel, like in 2020 so its heavier and not that optimized.
But, it has a lot of features and all those features work.
